# Group project by Maren, Eric and Anna-Kristina

# In this project we have worked in a data set containing data on laboratory values for a complete blood count and chemistry panel at least 4 weeks after start of thiopurine therapy in IBD patients. The file containing the original data set is exam_data.txt. 

# We have tidied this data set in the script read_tidy. R.

# We have combined this with additional data from the file exam_data_joindata.txt in the script adjust_explore.R and explored the data. 

# We have visualized and analyzed the combined data eset in the scripts visualization.R and analysis.R 

# In the end we produced a r-markdown file called final_report.
